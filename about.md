![Very cool description]({{ "/assets/images/peepoHappyL3ak.png" | relative_url }})

**Greetings! The purpose of this page is to tell you a little bit about myself.**

My name is Giorgi, and I'm from Georgia 🇬🇪. I am a blockchain security auditor at [OtterSec](https://osec.io/) and a PhD student at Arizona State University (ASU). Currently, I research blockchain systems, audit protocols and smart contracts for exploitable edge cases, and deliver remediation guidance to engineering teams. At ASU I've researched operating-system security (mainly Linux), focusing on vulnerability discovery, exploitation, and mitigation techniques, as well as low-level system security, including microarchitectural security and hardware–software interactions. The main purpose of this website is to post writeups and security-related articles. To post writeups one has to solve challenges, and to solve challenges one has to participate in CTFs. I'm a proud member of the CTF team [L3ak](https://www.l3ak.team/). I play <span style="color:#FF474C">**PWN**</span>, <span style="color:#7F3BCC">**Blockchain**</span>, and I'm trying to learn more about <span style="color:#00FFFF">**Crypto**</span> (because math is fun, especially abstract algebra).

**My life philosophy is this: nothing is impossible. If someone has done it, I can do it too and if no one has, then I’ll be the first one.**
