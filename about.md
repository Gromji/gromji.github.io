**Greetings, purpose of this page is to tell you little bit about myself.**

My name is Giorgi/George and I am a PhD student at Arizona State University (ASU) and a Research Assistant at SEFCOM. Main purpose of this website is to post writeups and other similar articles. To post writeups one has to solve challenges and to solve challenges one has to participate in CTFs. I'm a proud memeber of a CTF team, [L3ak](https://www.l3ak.team/). As seen from the picture above, I do <span style="color:#0ffc03">**PWN**</span>, <span style="color:#FF474C">**Blockchain**</span> and I'm trying to learn <span style="color:#00FFFF">**Crypto**</span>. That is all, I'm hoping to do amazing research with amazing people at ASU!
