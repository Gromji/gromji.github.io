![Very cool description]({{ "/assets/images/peepoHappyL3ak.png" | relative_url }})

**Greetings! The purpose of this page is to tell you a little bit about myself.**

My name is Giorgi and I am a PhD student at Arizona State University (ASU) and a Research Assistant at SEFCOM. I am currently doing research in Operating Systems (mainly Linux) security, focusing on vulnerability discovery, exploitation, and mitigation techniques, as well as low-level system security, including microarchitectural security and hardware-software interactions. But as seen from the picture above (which is from my team's website), I am just as interested (if not more) in Blockchain security. Main purpose of this website is to post writeups and other similar articles. To post writeups one has to solve challenges and to solve challenges one has to participate in CTFs. I'm a proud memeber of a CTF team, [L3ak](https://www.l3ak.team/). I play <span style="color:#FF474C">**PWN**</span>, <span style="color:#7F3BCC">**Blockchain**</span> and I'm trying to learn more about <span style="color:#00FFFF">**Crypto**</span> (because math is fun, especially abstract algebra).

**My life philosophy is this: nothing is impossible. If someone has done it, I can do it too and if no one has, then Iâ€™ll be the first one.**
