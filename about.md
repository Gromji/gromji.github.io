**Greetings, purpose of this page is to tell you little bit about myself.**

My name is Giorgi and I am a PhD student at Arizona State University (ASU) and a Research Assistant at SEFCOM. I am particularly interested in Operating Systems security (especially Linux), focusing on vulnerability discovery, exploitation, and mitigation techniques, as well as low-level system security, including microarchitectural security and hardware-software interactions. As implied by my intereasts, my research at SEFCOM centers around these topics. Main purpose of this website is to post writeups and other similar articles. To post writeups one has to solve challenges and to solve challenges one has to participate in CTFs. I'm a proud memeber of a CTF team, [L3ak](https://www.l3ak.team/). As seen from the picture above, I do <span style="color:#FF474C">**PWN**</span>, <span style="color:#7F3BCC">**Blockchain**</span> and I'm trying to learn <span style="color:#00FFFF">**Crypto**</span>. That is all, I'm hoping to do amazing research with amazing people at ASU!
